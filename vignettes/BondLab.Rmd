# Introduction
Investing in Mortgage and Asset backed securities requires specialized analytics.  The asset class is generally precieved as difficult to understand.  The underlying philosphy of Bond Lab is simple; mortgage and asset backed securities are not too complex to understand.

The percieved complexity of investing in strucutured products, like MBS, arise from four sources.  These are:
