Bond Lab® is an R package for the analysis of fixed income securities.  The 
analytical engines are modular in nature thereby allowing the user to create
a customized fixed income analytical output.  Bond Lab® is written in the S4
language and introduces a number of new classes.  

Bond Lab® classes are classified as those that support bonds (standard fixed income), mortgage- and asset-backed securities, analytic output, term structure. BondLab®
uses the following R packages:  
* termstrc  
* lubridate  
* methods  
* optimx  
* RCurl  
* splines  
* XML  
* knitr  
* devtools  
* testthat  
* rmarkdown  

All classes are exposed to the user thereby allowing the user to create new 
superclasses from existing classes or extend the classes as the user sees fit.  Bondlab classes are outlined below:


## Classes used to pass price, term structure, spreads, and rate scenarios  
 
* **PriceTypes**
  The PriceTypes class represents price as passed to functions. Price is passed
  to functions as a character.  The PriceTypes class converts the character value
  to numeric and string values. It contains Price (numeric), Price32nds(string),
  PriceBasis (numeric), and PriceDecimalString (character).  Price are be passed
  to BondLab® functions as characters in either decimal (.) or 32nds (-) format.

* **TermStructure**
  The TermStructure class represents the term structure of interest rates.  The 
  class contains forward rates, spot rates, two year forward, ten year forward.
  The constructuctor function TermStrucuture is a wrapper around the package 
  termstruc.

* **CurveSpreads**
  The CurvesSpreads class represents curve spreads.  It contains benchmark, 
  spread to benchmark, spread to curve, zero volatility spread.

* **Scenario**
  The scenario class represents interest rates used in total return scenario 
  analysis.  The user may define and scenario applied to either the coupon curve
  or the spot rate curve.  spot rate curve scenarios are designated with a trailing
  (s).

## Bond classes  
  Generally, speaking these classes pertain to a bond which pays a period coupon
  monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.  The bond may be callable, 
  putable, or have a sinking-fund schedule.  

* **BondDetails**
        The BondDetails class represents the cusip detail of a standard bond.  It
        includes all the relevant detail to analyze a standard fixed income
        security.  Call, Put, and Sinking Fund schedules are not yet implemented. 
* **BondCashFlows**
        The BondCashFlows class holds all the relevant detail regarding a bond's
        cashflow characteristics including: yield-to-maturity, weighted average
        life, modified duration, convexity, and bond cashflows coupon payments
        and principal payment(s), and total cash flow.
* **BondTermStructure**
        The BondTermStructure class represents the key rate duration and key rate
        convexity of bond.
*  **BondAnalytics**
        The BondAnalytics class is a superclass of BondTermStructure, BondDetails,
        BondCashFlows, and TermStructure.  The BondAnalytics class represents the
        measures which define the value of and a bond and the risk measures of a
        bond.  It is an example of creating a superclass from existing classes.
*   **BondReturn**
        The BondReturn class represents the total return of a bond.  The BondReturn
        class contains the coupon income, principal recieved, reinvestment income
        horizon balance, horizon price, horizon return, horizon months.  Note:
        currently under construction.
* **BondScenario**
        The BondScenario class represents the bond total return analysis.  It is
        a superclass of BondReturn, BondCashFlows, BondTermStructure, and 
        CurveSpreads.  Note: currently under construction.
