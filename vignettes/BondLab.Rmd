Bond Lab® is an R package for the analysis of fixed income securities.  The 
analytical engines are modular in nature thereby allowing the user to create
a customized fixed income analytical output.  Bond Lab® is written in the S4
language and introduces a number of new classes.  

Bond Lab® classes are classified as those that support bonds (standard fixed income), mortgage- and asset-backed securities, analytic output, term structure.  Bond Lab® uses the package TermStrc for its interest rates models.  The 
constructor function TermStructure is a wrapper around the package TermStrc.  All classes are exposued to the user thereby allowing the user to create new superclasses from existing classes or extend the classes as the user sees fit.  Bondlab classes are outlined below:

  Generally, speaking these classes pertain to a bond which pays a period coupon
  monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.  The bond may be callable, 
  putable, or have a sinking-fund schedule.

        The BondDetails class represents the cusip detail of a standard bond.  It
        includes all the relevant detail to analyze a standard fixed income
        security.  Call, Put, and Sinking Fund schedules are not yet implemented.

        The BondCashFlows class holds all the relevant detail regarding a bond's
        cashflow characteristics including: yield-to-maturity, weighted average
